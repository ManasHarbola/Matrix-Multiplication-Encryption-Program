# Matrix-Multiplication-Encryption-Program
Written in C++14 and compiled with Visual Studio C++ by Manas Harbola, Yash Patel, and Renuka Ravinder. (Original Date: April 25, 2017)

## Purpose/Function:
This program utilizes a randomly generated hill cipher 3x3 matrix to encrypt a given message string and stores the encrypted message into a .txt file which can later be decrypted. 

## How does it work?
1.) After clicking the .exe file of the program, the user is prompted with either encrypt/decrypt a message or exit the program. <br />
<br />
2.) If the user chooses to encrypt a message, they are prompted to type in the message they wish to encrypt followed by the name of the .txt which it will write to. If the user chooses to decrypt a message, they are prompted to specify the name of the encrypted file and the name of the decrypted file which it will make. If the user chooses to exit, the program will close automatically.

## Important Information:

1.) The .exe application file of this program is designed to write and read .txt files from the root of its location. For instance, if you put the .exe in a folder, it will write and read .txt files from that folder only. <br />

2.) Error handling for unacceptable inputs has been implemented in this program.
